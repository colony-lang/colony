# Colony Programming Language

Colony is pragmatic functional-first programming language.

Functional style is preferred over imperative,
however imperative is also supported yet discouraged.

All objects act like immutable values.
Data structures such as `struct`, `union`, `list` and `dict` are immutable.

This repository has C implementation of Colony programming language, and it is called "colony" for short.
It is experimental language which rapidly change and it is not production ready.
