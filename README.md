# Colony Programming Language

Colony is pragmatic functional-first programming language. Function style is preferred over imperative, however imperative is also supported yet discouraged. Data structures such as `list` and `dict` are immutable, however due to performance reasons their mutable counter parts `MutList` and `MutDict` exist.

This repository has C implementation of Colony programming language. It is experimental language which rapidly change and it is not production ready.
